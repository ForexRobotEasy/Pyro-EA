## Code Explanation

### Input Parameters

- `EntryAmount` (default: 0.01): The amount to trade for each position.
- `StopLoss` (default: 50.0): The stop loss in pips.
- `ProfitGoal` (default: 100.0): The profit goal in pips.

### Moving Average Settings

- `MA_Period` (default: 20): The period for calculating the Moving Average.
- `MA_Price` (default: PRICE_CLOSE): The applied price for Moving Average.

### Long/Short Indicator Settings

- `LS_Period` (default: 14): The period for calculating the Long/Short indicator.
- `LS_Level` (default: 0.5): The level for the Long/Short indicator.

### Global Variables

- `maBuffer[]`: Buffer for Moving Average values.
- `lsBuffer[]`: Buffer for Long/Short indicator values.

### Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function initializes the indicator buffers, sets the indicator labels and styles, and returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED`.

### Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function cleans up the indicator buffers.

### Trading Function

The `OnTick()` function is called for each tick and implements the trading logic.

1. It calculates the Moving Average and stores the values in the `maBuffer` array.
2. It calculates the Long/Short indicator using the `iCustom` function and stores the values in the `lsBuffer` array.
3. It checks the trading conditions based on the Moving Average and Long/Short indicator values.
   - If the current Moving Average is higher than the previous Moving Average and the Long/Short indicator value is above the specified level, it generates a buy signal.
   - If the current Moving Average is lower than the previous Moving Average and the Long/Short indicator value is below the specified level, it generates a sell signal.
4. If a buy signal is generated, it executes a buy trade with the specified entry amount, stop loss, and take profit levels.
5. If a sell signal is generated, it executes a sell trade with the specified entry amount, stop loss, and take profit levels.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not be suitable for live trading without further customization and risk management.
